Welcome to the AlbertPlus project! This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment, understanding the project architecture, and contributing to the AlbertPlus platform.

## What is AlbertPlus?

AlbertPlus is a comprehensive, open-source platform designed to enhance the course registration experience for New York University (NYU) students, built by the Fall 2025 Dev Team at Tech@NYU. It provides a modern, intuitive interface and a suite of tools to help students plan their academic journey, build schedules, and navigate the complexities of course selection. The project is a monorepo that consists of a web application, a browser extension, a web scraper, and a documentation site, all powered by a [convex](https://www.convex.dev/) backend.
