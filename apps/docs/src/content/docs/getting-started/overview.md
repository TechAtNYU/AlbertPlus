# Overview

Welcome to the AlbertPlus project! This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment, understanding the project architecture, and contributing to the AlbertPlus platform.

## What is AlbertPlus?

AlbertPlus is a comprehensive, open-source platform designed to enhance the course registration experience for New York University (NYU) students. It provides a modern, intuitive interface and a suite of tools to help students plan their academic journey, build schedules, and navigate the complexities of course selection. The project is a monorepo that consists of a web application, a browser extension, a web scraper, and a documentation site, all powered by a robust serverless backend.

## Project Goals

- **Modernize the Student Experience**: Provide a fast, responsive, and user-friendly alternative to the existing Albert system.
- **Simplify Course Planning**: Offer tools for degree progress tracking, schedule building, and course discovery.
- **Ensure Data Accuracy**: Maintain up-to-date course information through automated web scraping.
- **Foster Community Collaboration**: Build a platform that is developed and maintained by the NYU tech community.
